A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database#Database_management_system" target="_blank" title="dbms wiki">database</a> is an organized collection of data, stored and accessed electronically. <br />
Database designers typically organize the data to model aspects of reality in a way that supports processes requiring information, <br />
such as (for example) modeling the availability of rooms in hotels in a way that supports finding a hotel with vacancies. <br /><br />


<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database#Database_management_system" target="_blank" title="dbms wiki">The database management system (DBMS)</a> is the software that interacts with end users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. <br />
A general-purpose DBMS allows the definition, creation, querying, update, and administration of databases. <br />
A database is generally stored in a DBMS-specific format which is not portable, but different DBMSs can share data by using standards such as SQL and ODBC or JDBC. <br />
The sum total of the database, the DBMS and its associated applications can be referred to as a "database system". <br />
Often the term "database" is used to loosely refer to any of the DBMS, the database system or an application associated the database. <br /><br />

Computer scientists may classify database-management systems according to the database models that they support. <br />
Relational databases became dominant in the 1980s. <br />
These model data as rows and columns in a series of tables, and the vast majority use SQL for writing and querying data. <br />
In the 2000s, non-relational databases became popular, referred to as NoSQL because they use different query languages. <br />
